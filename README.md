# ParentalControlRemover
ParentalControlRemover is an Xbox 360 application that allows you to view the currently set Parental Control passcode or to clear it out if it is unknown. This is useful if you buy an Xbox 360 that has a Parental Control passcode set, and the seller did not disclose it.

As of version 2, it also will display the hidden settings reset code. This is the console-specific piece of the code that can be entered at the Console Settings > System Info area to reset settings. For instance, if your code is "LEFT - UP - RIGHT - X", then you would enter:

`LT + RT + X + Y + LB + RB + LEFT + UP + RIGHT + X`.
